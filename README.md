# remote-shutdown
quickly shutdown, control machineries from a distance in the industries in other to avoid fatal accident

After visiting some industries and analyzing some common accident that happens in the industries, I have come to find out that 70% of the accident were caused by supervisor or workers underestimating the speed at which a process is to be done and thus feel relaxed only for them to arrive at the machine late before hitting the emergency stop button.
